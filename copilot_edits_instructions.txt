Please generate a python script that reads in a set of GPS coordinates and then does geographical analysis on them.
The program will use an input which is a GPS location and a date.
You will research and select the best resource for freely available Sentinel or landsat data for the locations.
The python script shall:
    -Search the available databases for data on these locations and dates.
    -Select the data for the location and the dates that have the best visibility
    -download the data for these locations and dates with a 1km square area
    -Build a simple visualizer which can observe the downloaded data with a 1km square area
    -Display the visual data as well as standard indexes such as NDVI

# Comments and useful information for the client

# This script uses the Sentinel API to search and download Sentinel-2 data. 
# You need to replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your actual Copernicus Open Access Hub credentials.
# The script assumes that the downloaded file is named 'data.tif'. You may need to adjust the file name based on the actual downloaded file.
# Ensure you have the required libraries installed: requests, matplotlib, numpy, rasterio, sentinelsat.
# You can install them using pip:
# pip install requests matplotlib numpy rasterio sentinelsat
